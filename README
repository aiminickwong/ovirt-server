The oVirt Server is an open cross-platform virtualization management
system. It provides a web-based management interface that enables
users to manage hosts and storage, install and remove virtual machines
and level resources across a large group of machines. The oVirt Server
manages hosts running the oVirt Node Image. oVirt Server Suite scales
from a small group of users with little need for access control and
quota management, all the way up to hundreds of hosts with robust
control over grouping, permissions, and quotas.

This is a very simple client library for accessing the OVirt API from Ruby.

The file examples/script.rb contains a script that shows how this is done
in some detail.

You must have ActiveResource installed, e.g. with 'yum install
rubygem-activeresource'

The server is specified with a URL of the form
  http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/ovirt

This requires that the server is configured to allow HTTP authentication,
since there are no mechanisms in the API to forward krb5 tickets.

Before calling any other method on the API, you need to call
  OVirt::Base::site = "http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/ovirt"
  OVirt::Base::login
